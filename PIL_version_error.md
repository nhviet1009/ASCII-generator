The error occurs because the `getsize` method is no longer available in newer versions of the Pillow (PIL) library for `FreeTypeFont` objects. This method has been deprecated and removed. Specifically, the error message is:

```
AttributeError: 'FreeTypeFont' object has no attribute 'getsize'
```

This indicates that the `font.getsize()` call is not recognized as a valid method for `FreeTypeFont`. 

To resolve the issue, you should replace the `getsize` method with `font.getbbox()` or `font.getmask()` in your code. The `getbbox()` method returns the bounding box (the coordinates of the character's box), which can then be used to calculate the width and height of the character. For example, replace:

```python
char_width, char_height = font.getsize("A")
```

With:

```python
bbox = font.getbbox("A")
char_width = bbox[2] - bbox[0]
char_height = bbox[3] - bbox[1]
```

This change will allow the code to run properly on newer versions of Pillow.
